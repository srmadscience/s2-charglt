# s2-charglt
SingleStore implementation of [Charglt](https://github.com/srmadscience/voltdb-charglt), but on SingleStore

It Has the  basic functionality of charglt, but is missing stuff  - see TODO

## TODO
* user_recent_transactions - needs to be selected into kafka. Have added a script
  ( send_to_kafka.sql) that should do this but it isn't working as of today.

## Status

While this is fine to play with, it's not a fair representation of SingleStore at the moment.
